Problem Description :
  "NÄ›mec's quadratic law: how many minutes the teacher was late to the lesson, that many minutes squared he'll end the lesson earlier." 
 
    In other words, if the teacher is t minutes late (for some non-negative integer t), he should end the lesson t2 minutes early. Of course, this means the teacher can't be too late, because a lesson can't end before even starting. It is, however, possible for the teacher to arrive and end the lesson immediately (in fact, he then only arrives to tell the students that the lesson's cancelled).
 
    You're given a long integer d. The lesson was supposed to take d minutes. Compute and return the largest non-negative integer t such that the teacher can be t minutes late.
