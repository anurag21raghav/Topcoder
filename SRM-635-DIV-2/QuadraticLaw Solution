Required value "t" should be such that teacher have to attend class for the minimum time.
Hence, the total time acquired in coming to the class and the remaining time after the teacher leave the class can maximum be "d".

So, t**2 + t <= d.

As in programming, direct formula can sometimes lead to precision errors, we will check the neighbouring values too to satisfy the equation.


import math
class QuadraticLaw:
    def getTime(self, d):
        temp = int(math.floor(((float(float(math.sqrt(1+(4*d)))) - 1))/2))
        if (temp+(temp*temp))>d:
            return temp-1
        if ((temp+1) + (temp+1)*(temp+1))>d:
            return temp
        if ((temp+2) + (temp+2)*(temp+2))>d:
            return temp+1
